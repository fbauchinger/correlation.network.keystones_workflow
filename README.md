workflow.R  
R Script containing basic FastSpar usage and workflow for computing a robust consensus network from multiple FastSpar runs  
  
test_data:  
community_profile.tsv ... example input data for FastSpar (containing total reads; OTUs are rows; samples are columns)  
pvalues_[1:10].tsv ... example output files containing p-values of 10 different FastSpar runs (each run with a random subsample from a bigger dataset)  
observed_correlations_[1:10].tsv ... example output files containing observed correlations of 10 different FastSpar runs (each run with a random subsample from a bigger dataset)
